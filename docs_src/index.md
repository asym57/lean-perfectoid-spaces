# What is it about?

We explained Peter Scholze's definition of perfectoid spaces to
computers, using the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io/), mainly developed by
[Leonardo de Moura](https://leodemoura.github.io/).
Building on earlier work by many people, starting from first
principles, we arrived at
```lean
-- We fix a prime number p
parameter (p : Prime)

structure perfectoid_ring (R : Type) [Huber_ring R] extends Tate_ring R : Prop :=
(complete  : is_complete_hausdorff R)
(uniform   : is_uniform R)
(ramified  : ‚àÉ œñ : pseudo_uniformizer R, œñ^p ‚à£ p in R·µí)
(Frobenius : surjective (Frob R·µí‚àïp))

CLVRS ("complete locally valued ringed space") is a category
whose objects are topological spaces with a sheaf of complete topological rings
and an equivalence class of valuation on each stalk, whose support is the unique
maximal ideal of the stalk; in Wedhorn's notes this category is called ùí±.
A perfectoid space is an object of CLVRS which is locally isomorphic to Spa(A) with
A a perfectoid ring. Note however that CLVRS is a full subcategory of the category
`PreValuedRingedSpace` of topological spaces equipped with a presheaf of topological
rings and a valuation on each stalk, so the isomorphism can be checked in
PreValuedRingedSpace instead, which is what we do.

neighbourhood isomorphic to Spa(A) for some perfectoid ring A.-/

You can read more explanations about [how to read this code](how-to-read-lean.html).

Starting from first principles means every definition and every lemma
needed to make sense of the above lines has been explained to
computers, by us or [other people](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/graphs/contributors), and checked by computers.

Each node in the following graph is a definition or statement used
directly or indirectly in the definition of perfectoid spaces, or in the
proofs of the required lemmas. Each edge is a use. There are more than
3000 nodes and 30000 edges. The spatial layout and cluster coloring was
computed by [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).
![Perfectoid definition graph](images/perfectoid_graph.png)
Labels were added by hand. The big star is the definition of perfectoid
spaces. All other nodes have a size depending on how many nodes use
them. You can play with the [gephi source](perfectoid.gephi). 
Note that, although the definition of perfectoid spaces is
there, we are still working on making the project more beautiful, so
the graph maybe be not perfectly faithful to its current state.

If you want to explore the project interactively, you can read our
[installation instructions](install.html).

## I am a mathematician. How do I learn Lean?

You can read [theorem proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/). Do note however that this whole thing is all very beta at the minute. We think [Tom Hales describes it best](https://jiggerwit.wordpress.com/2018/04/14/the-architecture-of-proof-assistants/).
