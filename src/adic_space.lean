# Adic spaces

Adic spaces were introduced by Huber in [Huber]. They form a very general category of objects
suitable for p-adic geometry.

In this file we define the category of adic spaces. The category of schemes (from algebraic
geometry) may provide some useful intuition for the definition.
One defines the category of ‚Äúringed spaces‚Äù, and for every commutative ring R
a ringed space Spec(R). A scheme is a ringed space that admits a cover by subspaces that
are isomorphic to spaces of the form Spec(R) for some ring R.

Similarly, for adic spaces we need two ingredients: a category CLVRS,
and the so-called ‚Äùadic spectrum‚Äù Spa(_), which is defined in Spa.lean.
An adic space is an object of CLVRS is that admits a cover by subspaces of the form Spa(A).

The main bulk of this file consists in setting up the category that we called CLVRS,
and that never got a proper name in the literature. (For example, Wedhorn calls this category `ùí±`.)

CLVRS (complete locally valued ringed space) is the category of topological spaces endowed
with a sheaf of complete topological rings and (an equivalence class of) valuations on the stalks
(which are required to be local rings; moreover the support of the valuation must be
the maximal ideal of the stalk).

Once we have the category CLVRS in place, the definition of adic spaces is made in
a couple of lines.

between a general adic space and an affinoid model Spa(A) can be checked in this category.

Remark: One can show that for every morphism in CLVRS,
the induced maps on stalks are local ring morphisms.
Sketch of proof: the valuation on the source pulls back to the valuation on the target,
and by assumption `supp_maximal` this means that the maximal ideal on the target
is mapped into the maximal ideal on the source.
