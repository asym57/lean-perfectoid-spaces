Sheaves in Lean
===============

Most of files in this directory are based on work of
Ramon Fernandez Mir in the schemes project
(https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme).

The resulting code is functional, but by stacking
sheaves of topological rings on top of sheaves of rings
on top of sheaves of sets (i.e., sheaves of types)
the API becomes very clunky. In conclusion,
this code is not stable, and will need a thorough makeover
before being ready for consumption by the general public.
